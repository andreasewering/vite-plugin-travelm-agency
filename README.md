# Vite Plugin for Travelm Agency

This is a vite plugin that runs the Travelm-Agency compiler on your translation files
on build start and also when the translation files change.

The options are the same as for the Travelm-Agency compiler itself.
DevMode is automatically turned on/off depending on if you are running the dev server
or bundling for production.
